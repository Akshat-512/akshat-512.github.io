Hello, I'm Akshat. I am 21 years old. I am a software developer at <b>Cisco Systems, Bangalore</b>. As you could guess by the website, my interests include Music, Literature and Movies. I want to document my thoughts on some really good books I like, some really good albums, songs and artists I like, as well as great movies and directors I admire.
